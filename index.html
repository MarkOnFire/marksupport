  <h2>Series of stories on the role the computation is playing in economic study <span class="fa fa-external-link-square"></span></h2>
  <p>The initial piece was on computation at a high level, with two follow-up pieces on the specific impact that <a href="http://bfi.uchicago.edu/news/feature-story/when-machine-thinks-what-does-it-assume">machine learning</a> might have on economic problem solving, as well as how students should prepare themselves for the <a href="http://bfi.uchicago.edu/news/feature-story/computation-and-classroom">future role computation may play</a> in their lives as economists.</p>

  <h2>Engaging with an expert audience on Twitter <span class="fa fa-external-link-square"></span></h2>
  <p>Running point on the Twitter account for a highly-respected institution can be intimidating, but if you hold yourself to a high standard, the audience rewards you for it.</p>

  <h2>Flipped classrooms and the advantages of mixed online/offline learning <span class="fa fa-external-link-square"></span></h2>

  <h2>Closing the loop on big data â€¦ one beer at a time <span class="fa fa-external-link-square"></span></h2>
  <p>Unlike computers, people cannot be upgraded. They work at a finite speed and at rising costs, so Rob Nowak is improving interactive systems that can optimize the performance of both humans and machines tackling big data problems together.</p>
